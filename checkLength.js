The information here was complied from discussions with various market participants, the Amarillo MLS, local realtors, the Potter County and Randall County Clerk's office and other public records. The subject was purchased from an estate as an investment and rental property. The terms of the sale were not disclosed. Summary of Sales Comparison Approach The appraiser comparable search is based on existing home sales in the Wolflin neighborhood as described in the general addenda, sold in the past 12 months with up to 1,250 square feet and 2 or more bedrooms, 1 or more baths, with or without a garage. Ideally, the most current sales are considered the most reasonable. The search for potential comparable sales started with a 3 month time period which revealed 2 sales and 6 pending/listings. The search was then expanded to a 6 month period, resulting in 6 additional sales It was then expanded to 12 months which revealed 12 more sales that could be comparable with the subject. This list of sales was then analyzed to determine those sales and listings which were considered the most comparable to the subject. This set of sales brackets the size, the condition, room count, gross living area and other amenities. The four sales and two listings presented in this analysis are the best and only representative sales of homes of this quality, style and appeal. Individual adjustment and how each was derived are presented in the Market Approach to Value section of the general addenda Indicated Value by Sales Comparison Approach $ 76,500 Indicated Value by: Sales Comparison Approach $ 76,500 Cost Approach (if developed) $ 78,100 Income Approach (if developed) $ 76,500 All three approaches to value have been considered and presented The income approach is included as requested by the client. Several of the homes in this area are purchased for the rental income they might generate. The cost approach was developed employing sales of vacant, developed lots located in southwest Amarillo in order to calculate a lot value See General Addenda for a further discussion of the reconciliation This appraisal is made "as is" subject to completion per plans and specifications on the basis of a hypothetical condition that the improvements have been completed, subject to the following repairs or alterations on the basis of a hypothetical condition that the repairs or alterations have been completed, or subject to the following required inspection based on the extraordinary assumption that the condition or deficiency does not require alteration or repair: Based on a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, defined scope of work, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and appraiser's certification, my (our) opinion of the market value, as defined, of the real property that is the subject of this report is $ 76,500 as of 12/05/2019 which is the date of inspection and the effective date of this appraisal.

This report form is not designed to report an appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a condominium or cooperative project. This appraisal report is subject to the following scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended use, intended user, definition of market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may expand the scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this appraisal assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted. However, additional certifications that do not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such as those required by law or those related to the appraiser's continuing education or membership in an appraisal organization, are permitted. SCOPE OF WORK: The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and the reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a minimum: (1) perform a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject property, (2) inspect the neighborhood, (3) inspect each of the comparable sales from at least the street, (4) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable public and/or private sources, and (5) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this appraisal report. INTENDED USE: The intended use of this appraisal report is for the lender/client to evaluate the property that is the subject of this appraisal for a mortgage finance transaction. INTENDED USER: The intended user of this appraisal report is the lender/client. DEFINITION OF MARKET VALUE: The most probable price which a property should bring in a competitive and open market under all conditions requisite to a fair sale, the buyer and seller, each acting prudently, knowledgeably and assuming the price is not affected by undue stimulus. Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale as of a specified date and the passing of title from seller to buyer under conditions whereby: (1) buyer and seller are typically motivated; (2) both parties are well informed or well advised, and each acting in what he or she considers his or her own best interest; (3) a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market; (4) payment is made in terms of cash in U. S. dollars or in terms of financial arrangements comparable thereto; and (5) the price represents the normal consideration for the property sold unaffected by special or creative financing or sales concessions* granted by anyone associated with the sale. *Adjustments to the comparables must be made for special or creative financing or sales concessions. No adjustments are necessary for those costs which are normally paid by sellers as a result of tradition or law in a market area; these costs are readily identifiable since the seller pays these costs in virtually all sales transactions. Special or creative financing adjustments can be made to the comparable property by comparisons to financing terms offered by a third party institutional lender that is not already involved in the property or transaction. Any adjustment should not be calculated on a mechanical dollar for dollar cost of the financing or concession but the dollar amount of any adjustment should approximate the market's reaction to the financing or concessions based on the appraiser's judgment. STATEMENT OF ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITING CONDITIONS: The appraiser's certification in this report is subject to the following assumptions and limiting conditions: 1. The appraiser will not be responsible for matters of a legal nature that affect either the property being appraised or the title to it, except for information that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing this appraisal. The appraiser assumes that the title is good and marketable and will not render any opinions about the title. 2. The appraiser has provided a sketch in this appraisal report to show the approximate dimensions of the improvements. The sketch is included only to assist the reader in visualizing the property and understanding the appraiser's determination of its size. 3. The appraiser has examined the available flood maps that are provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or other data sources) and has noted in this appraisal report whether any portion of the subject site is located in an identified Special Flood Hazard Area. Because the appraiser is not a surveyor, he or she makes no guarantees, express or implied, regarding this determination. 4. The appraiser will not give testimony or appear in court because he or she made an appraisal of the property in question, unless specific arrangements to do so have been made beforehand, or as otherwise required by law. 5. The appraiser has noted in this appraisal report any adverse conditions (such as needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, etc.) observed during the inspection of the subject property or that he or she became aware of during the research involved in performing the appraisal. Unless otherwise stated in this appraisal report, the appraiser has no knowledge of any hidden or unapparent physical deficiencies or adverse conditions of the property (such as, but not limited to, needed repairs, deterioration, the presence of hazardous wastes, toxic substances, adverse environmental conditions, etc.) that would make the property less valuable, and has assumed that there are no such conditions and makes no guarantees or warranties, express or implied. The appraiser will not be responsible for any such conditions that do exist or for any engineering or testing that might be required to discover whether such conditions exist. Because the appraiser is not an expert in the field of environmental hazards, this appraisal report must not be considered as an environmental assessment of the property. 6. The appraiser has based his or her appraisal report and valuation conclusion for an appraisal that is subject to satisfactory completion, repairs, or alterations on the assumption that the completion, repairs, or alterations of the subject property will be performed in a professional manner.

The size, quality design and conditions of the homes in the area are similar throughout. The demographics and potential buyer pool is virtually the same for the entire area. In order to collect a similar group of similar properties, the neighborhood search is expanded to include the Bivins area, north of Interstate 40 and the Oliver-Eakle/AC are to the east. These neighborhoods are very similar in development and make-up as the Wolflin neighborhood. Neighborhood Description: Based on the boundary description, the east, south and west boundaries are three of the major traffic street in southwest Amarillo. The north boundary, Interstate 40, is the major traffic carrier for the southwest United States. Georgia Street is mostly the center traffic carrier for all of southwest Amarillo. At the southern end of the neighborhood is Interstate 27, the major north/south traffic carrier for all areas of the Texas Panhandle. All of this neighborhood is historical in nature as some homes are older, larger estate type homes build in the early 1910's and are or were home to some of the city founders. Market Conditions: A statistical analysis of the defined neighborhood, limited to 1,200 square feet, with similar amenities and condition, reveals a total of 20 sales with a median sold price of $80,00 with 42 days on the market, 4 listed properties with a median list price of $89,500 and 56 days on the market and 2 pending sales with a median list price of $75,000 and 73 days on the market, over the past 12 months, indicating a stable market. Site and Improvements Description and Information Site: The site dimensions reported, 50.00 X 133.55', are reported by the Potter-Randall Appraisal District, PRAD, and are representative of the actual square feet in the property. Without a survey, the assumption can be made the actual square feet in this site are as reported by PRAD. Zoning: The zoning office of the City of Amarillo has been contacted and the correct zoning is R-3; residential district 3. This zoning allows for use as a single family, detached dwelling with associated garages and out buildings. The subject meets the zoning requirements. Highest and Best Use as Vacant: The highest and best use of the site, as though vacant has four limiting conditions: physically possible, legally permissible, financially feasible and maximally productive. As described, the site meets the physically possible, there is plenty of land area, and the legally possible, it meets the zoning requirements. The financially feasible factor is limited by size and legal uses, meaning the financially feasible and maximally productive aspects of the is analysis conclude the Highest and Best Use of this site, as though vacant, to be developed as a single family dwelling. Highest and Best Use as Improved: The highest and best use of this property, as improved, is as a single family dwelling, based on the physical structure and the zoning requirement. The feasible and maximally productive requirements limit the use, as though improved as a single family dwelling. Condition: The condition of this property is considered C4. The roof appears to be in good condition. The siding appears to be in average condition with no visible cracks or damage. Market Approach To Value Comparisons and adjustments: There are many acceptable applications to determine and adjustment in the market. Considered the best way to calculate an adjustment is the paired sales analysis. This approach takes data directly from the Amarillo Real Estate market. Cash Equivalency: Each of the sales was analyzed to determine the cash equivalency sales price. This means that and variations from typical terms of the sale, including seller paid concessions, personal property and other abnormal conditions were analyzed. Location: The subject is located along the access road to Interstate 40, a major traffic carrier in the region. In order to determine if this location has an impact on value, a search for homes along the access road, both north and south, was undertaken. The search revealed 1 sale on the access road, north of the subject at 1619 S Milam St. This home is a 1,518 square foot home in C3 condition. It sold in May 2019 for $133,249 or $87.81 per square foot. In comparison, the home at 2205 S Fannin, 2 blocks off of the interstate, is a 1,591 square foot home in C3 condition. It sold for $132,400 or $83.22 per square foot. This comparison shows that no adjustment is necessary for location. Land Size: Land sizes vary slightly from 6,600 to 7,800 square feet. The subject has 6,978 square feet, similar to the comparables. There is no evidence in the market that a land size adjustment should be made. All of these lots are considered to be a single building lot and can not be separated or divided and sold as separate units. All meet the zoning requirements for lot size. Age and Condition: Ages vary, and are a function of the condition. The conditions of the subject, as discussed previously, is C4, meaning it is in above average to good condition. All of the comparables as well as the listings are considered to have a C4 condition. Room Count: There is no evidence, in this market, that an adjustment for the number of bedrooms is necessary, this difference is absorbed in the gross living area. Bath adjustment is based on a paired sales analysis between sales in this neighborhood, a difference of $1,500 for a bath and $750 for a half bath. Gross Living Area: To determine and adjustment for the gross living area (size) adjustment, an analysis of all the sales employed for this analysis, the square foot range is $72.68 to $89.74, a difference of $17.06 per square foot, rounded to $20.00. Garage: The difference in car storage, is calculated from a paired sales analysis of sales 1 and 2 resulting in a difference of $1,100 for no garage versus a 1-car garage. Final Analysis: Net adjustments range from 2.2% to 7.1%. The adjusted sales prices range from $71,520 to $77,570. Comparables 3 and 4 have the least net adjustments are while comparables 1 and 2 are considered most physically similar to the subject. Based on this analysis, the indicated value by the market approach is $76,500. Reconciliation Continuing from page 2 of the URAR; Marshall and Swift Cost Estimator was employed to derive a cost of replacement for the improvements. This added to the value indication of the land is the value estimate from the cost approach. The Sales Comparison approach was developed from the historical sales in this neighborhood. The number of sales and listing was adequate to analyze for this approach. This list of sales and listings was paired down to determine the most comparable which are presented. Each are weighted based on their comparability. Sales 1 and 2 are considered the most comparable and given the most weight being similar in design, condition an appeal. The Sales Comparison Approach is the most similar to the current market trends and is most reflective of the current market conditions. The cost approach presented lends good support to the market value.

The entire structure and all components are new and the dwelling features no physical depreciation. Note: Newly constructed improvements that feature recycled or previously used materials and/or components can be considered new dwellings provided that the dwelling is placed on a 100 percent new foundation and the recycled materials and the recycled components have been rehabilitated/remanufactured into like-new condition. Improvements that have not been previously occupied are not considered "new" if they have any significant physical depreciation (that is, newly constructed dwellings that have been vacant for an extended period of time without adequate maintenance or upkeep). C2 The improvements feature no deferred maintenance, little or no physical depreciation, and require no repairs. Virtually all building components are new or have been recently repaired, refinished, or rehabilitated. All outdated components and finishes have been updated and/or replaced with components that meet current standards. Dwellings in this category are either almost new or have been recently completely renovated and are similar in condition to new construction. Note: The improvements represent a relatively new property that is well maintained with no deferred maintenance and little or no physical depreciation, or an older property that has been recently completely renovated. C3 The improvements are well maintained and feature limited physical depreciation due to normal wear and tear. Some components, but not every major building component, may be updated or recently rehabilitated. The structure has been well maintained. Note: The improvement is in its first-cycle of replacing short-lived building components (appliances, floor coverings, HVAC, etc.) and is being well maintained. Its estimated effective age is less than its actual age. It also may reflect a property in which the majority of short-lived building components have been replaced but not to the level of a complete renovation. C4 The improvements feature some minor deferred maintenance and physical deterioration due to normal wear and tear. The dwelling has been adequately maintained and requires only minimal repairs to building components/mechanical systems and cosmetic repairs. All major building components have been adequately maintained and are functionally adequate. Note: The estimated effective age may be close to or equal to its actual age. It reflects a property in which some of the short-lived building components have been replaced, and some short-lived building components are at or near the end of their physical life expectancy; however, they still function adequately. Most minor repairs have been addressed on an ongoing basis resulting in an adequately maintained property. C5 The improvements feature obvious deferred maintenance and are in need of some significant repairs. Some building components need repairs, rehabilitation, or updating. The functional utility and overall livability is somewhat diminished due to condition, but the dwelling remains useable and functional as a residence. Note: Some significant repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of adequate maintenance. It reflects a property in which many of its short-lived building components are at the end of or have exceeded their physical life expectancy but remain functional. C6 The improvements have substantial damage or deferred maintenance with deficiencies or defects that are severe enough to affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements. The improvements are in need of substantial repairs and rehabilitation, including many or most major components. Note: Substantial repairs are needed to the improvements due to the lack of adequate maintenance or property damage. It reflects a property with conditions severe enough to affect the safety, soundness, or structural integrity of the improvements. Quality Ratings and Definitions Q1 Dwellings with this quality rating are usually unique structures that are individually designed by an architect for a specified user. Such residences typically are constructed from detailed architectural plans and specifications and feature an exceptionally high level of workmanship and exceptionally high-grade materials throughout the interior and exterior of the structure. The design features exceptionally high-quality exterior refinements and ornamentation, and exceptionally high-quality interior refinements. The workmanship, materials, and finishes throughout the dwelling are of exceptionally high quality. Q2 Dwellings with this quality rating are often custom designed for construction on an individual property owner's site. However, dwellings in this quality grade are also found in high-quality tract developments featuring residence constructed from individual plans or from highly modified or upgraded plans. The design features detailed, high quality exterior ornamentation, high-quality interior refinements, and detail. The workmanship, materials, and finishes throughout the dwelling are generally of high or very high quality. UAD Version 9/2011 (Updated 4/2012) Serial# EDFA4292 Form UADDEFINE1 "TOTAL" appraisal software by a la mode, inc. - 1-800-ALAMODE esign.alamode.com/verify UNIFORM APPRAISAL DATASET (UAD) DEFINITIONS ADDENDUM (Source: Fannie Mae UAD Appendix D: UAD Field-Specific Standardization Requirements) Quality Ratings and Definitions (continued) Q3 Dwellings with this quality rating are residences of higher quality built from individual or readily available designer plans in above-standard residential tract developments or on an individual property owner's site. The design includes significant exterior ornamentation and interiors that are well finished. The workmanship exceeds acceptable standards and many materials and finishes throughout the dwelling have been upgraded from "stock" standards. Q4 Dwellings with this quality rating meet or exceed the requirements of applicable building codes. Standard or modified standard building plans are utilized and the design includes adequate fenestration and some exterior ornamentation and interior refinements. Materials, workmanship, finish, and equipment are of stock or builder grade and may feature some upgrades. Q5 Dwellings with this quality rating feature economy of construction and basic functionality as main considerations. Such dwellings feature a plain design using readily available or basic floor plans featuring minimal fenestration and basic finishes with minimal exterior ornamentation and limited interior detail. These dwellings meet minimum building codes and are constructed with inexpensive, stock materials with limited refinements and upgrades. Q6 Dwellings with this quality rating are of basic quality and lower cost; some may not be suitable for year-round occupancy. Such dwellings are often built with simple plans or without plans, often utilizing the lowest quality building materials. Such dwellings are often built or expanded by persons who are professionally unskilled or possess only minimal construction skills. Electrical, plumbing, and other mechanical systems and equipment may be minimal or non-existent. Older dwellings may feature one or more substandard or non-conforming additions to the original structure Definitions of Not Updated, Updated, and Remodeled Not Updated Little or no updating or modernization. This description includes, but is not limited to, new homes. Residential properties of fifteen years of age or less often reflect an original condition with no updating, if no major components have been replaced or updated. Those over fifteen years of age are also considered not updated if the appliances, fixtures, and finishes are predominantly dated. An area that is "Not Updated' may still be well maintained and fully functional, and this rating does not necessarily imply deferred maintenance or physical/functional deterioration. Updated The area of the home has been modified to meet current market expectations. These modifications are limited in terms of both scope and cost. An updated area of the home should have an improved look and feel, or functional utility. Changes that constitute updates include refurbishment and/or replacing components to meet existing market expectations. Updates do not include significant alterations to the existing structure. Remodeled Significant finish and/or structural changes have been made that increase utility and appeal through complete replacement and/or expansion. A remodeled area reflects fundamental changes that include multiple alterations. These alterations may include some or all of the following: replacement of a major component (cabinet(s), bathtub, or bathroom tile), relocation of plumbing/gas fixtures/appliances, significant structural alterations (relocating walls, and/or the addition of) square footage). This would include a complete gutting and rebuild. Explanation of Bathroom Count Three-quarter baths are counted as a full bath in all cases. Quarter baths (baths that feature only a toilet) are not included in the bathroom count. The number of full and half baths is reported by separating the two values using a period, where the full bath count is represented to the left of the period and the half bath count is represented to the right of the period. Example: 3.2 indicates three full baths and two half baths.
